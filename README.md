# ausbhopserver

A large part of this repository is merely as a reference, you will have to find the updated & working files yourself, they are out there on github and I know this because that's where I got 99% of what's here. 

a place to upload and keep track of changes for the aus bhop bunny hop australian counter strike global offensive server. This is intended to become a public archive for when I can no longer be arsed paying for the server
