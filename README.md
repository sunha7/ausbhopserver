# ausbhopserver

A large part of this repository is merely as a reference, you will have to find the updated & working files yourself, they are out there on github and I know this because that's where I got 99% of what's here. 

a place to upload and keep track of changes for the aus bhop bunny hop australian counter strike global offensive server. This is intended to become a public archive for when I can no longer be arsed paying for the server

beyond this, github search is very good.
rip bhop, best of luck to anyone who tries to continue

i may upload more replays overtime but don't count on it, if you remember a record that you had and would like it to be uploaded your best bet is to message me on discord

shoutout gcg for having all this and not hosting an aussie server even though i prewarned about costs and gave viable solutions. 2vcpu 2gb ram is plenty, the thing needed most for bhop is the map storage space if you want to keep all 2-3k maps without cycling through them. Do what you can to focus on cpu performance with linux governors - we were able to get our var down from about 0.080 to a very consistent <0.010.
